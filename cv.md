# Research Experience

## Hedrick Lab, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University

**3D Printing for Veterinary Education** (June 2024 - Present)

- Develop an explodable dog skull as a hands-on teaching aid for
  veterinary education by working with CT data (Avizo software) and 3D
  printing (Formlabs Form 3B)

**MiniMMorph (Miniaturized Mammalian Morphologies)** (June 2024 -
Present)

- Investigate the effect of miniaturization on the diversity and
  disparity of rodents, soricids (shrews), and talpids (moles) using 3D
  geometric morphometrics

- Gain proficiency in navigating MorphoSource (a publicly accessible
  repository) for CT (computed tomography) data, performing digital
  segmentation with Avizo software for 3D visualization of CT data, and
  analyzing variation in 3D shape in the skull and postcranial
  morphology of miniature mammal species

**SPARCNet (Salamander Population Adaptation Research Collaboration
Network) Initiative** (June 2023 - Present)

- Assist with the placement of coverboard arrays and weekly
  mark-recapture of individual *Plethodon cinereus* (red-backed
  salamander) at three sites across Tompkins County, New York to track
  population and behavioral changes at both the macroclimatic and
  microclimatic scale, as well as responses to increasing urbanization

**Undergraduate Honors Thesis in Biological Sciences** (September 2022 -
May 2024)

- Investigated the effect of taphonomic deformation on cranial shape of
  †*Diictodon feliceps*, a basal therapsid from the Late Permian Karoo
  Basin of South Africa, using 3D geometric morphometrics
- Gained proficiency in 3D geometric morphometrics, analyses of 3D data,
  and coding in R (programming language)

**Comparative Geometric Morphometrics** (June 2023 - August 2023)

- Compare multiple geometric morphometrics approaches (2DGM, 3DGM via
  surface scanner, 3DGM via StereoMorph) on the crania of *Didelphis
  virginiana* (Virginia opossum) to assess biological trends (e.g.,
  sexual shape, size dimorphism, allometry) across the three datasets
  and evaluate the consistency of the datasets themselves using partial
  least squares analysis

# **Teaching Experience**

## BioEE/EAS 1560 – Introductory Oceanography with Laboratory

**Teaching Assistant, Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences**
(August 2024 – December 2024)

- Teach two weekly laboratory sessions to help students understand not
  only ocean physics and marine biology but also environmental threats
  to ocean health and sustainability including climate change,
  overharvesting of marine resources, ocean acidification, and coastal
  pollution
- Additional responsibilities include addressing student
  questions/concerns, grading assignments and quizzes, and assisting
  with proctoring the two preliminary exams and final exam

## BioEE 2740 – The Vertebrates: Comparative Anatomy, Function, Paleontology, and Evolution

**Teaching Assistant, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology**
(January 2024 – May 2024)

- Taught weekly 3-hour laboratory session using specimens from the
  teaching collections of the Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates
  and Paleontological Research Institute to help students understand the
  origin, anatomy, physiology, paleontology, and evolution of
  vertebrates

## BioEE/EAS 4795 – Vertebrate Paleontology: Dinosaurs and Other Stories from Deep Time

**Teaching Assistant, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology**
(August 2023 – December 2023)

- Develop course content for and teach weekly 3-hour laboratory and
  50-minute discussion sessions to help students trace the evolutionary
  history of vertebrates throughout the Phanerozoic
  - Laboratory session: consult the teaching collections of the
    Paleontological Research Institute and Cornell University Museum of
    Vertebrates, exhibits at the Museum of the Earth, and personal
    fossil collection to pull appropriate fossil and Recent vertebrate
    material for comparative anatomical study
  - Discussion session: design lecture content, small-group breakout
    session activities, and discussion board prompts to reinforce course
    content from the two 50-minute lecture sessions and explore concepts
    in detail, such as the effects of large-scale Earth system
    processes, mass extinctions, and the evolution of terrestrial
    plants/insects on vertebrate diversity
- Organize and co-host an intercollegiate field trip to the Late
  Devonian Catskill Formation of northcentral PA to expose students to a
  site of active vertebrate paleontological research and strengthen
  fundamental field geology skills
